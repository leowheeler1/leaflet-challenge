## Info

Each point on this map represents an earthquake that occured within the last 7 days. The points on the map are all colored by their depth; red is deeper, green is shallower. The size of the points is dependent upon the magnitude of the earthquake. Any earthquake with a magnitude of 1 or less is set at the default size to avoid them being too small to see. Included in this repo are also some static images from the interactive map, which are found in `Images`, but are also included at the bottom of this `README`.
